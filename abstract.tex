The underrepresentation within CS of women, domestic students of
color, and lower-SES students remains a national issue. Recent
studies demonstrate two critical factors: Persistent stereotypes
about "who does computer science" can cause members of these groups
to preclude interest in the field \cite{Cheryan2010}; many
also perceive computing as "irrelevant" and "asocial" \cite{Guzdial2009}.
While these issues must be addressed at multiple ages and
levels, many suggest that we should start early, before students
have developed both types of stereotypes \cite{McGill2015}.

As a step in combating (mis-)perceptions of ability and relevance,
we developed and conducted a spectrum of week-long summer "code
camps" for regional middle-school students. These camps emphasize
meaningful uses of computing, on building self-efficacy, and on
broadening understanding of who does and can do computer science.
In this paper, we focus on our "data science for social good" camp,
in which students explored computational approaches to data science
through a lens of computing for social good \cite{Goldweber2013},
discovering how computing helps them not only better understand
societal issues but also convince others to address problems.

We discuss the rationale for the curriculum and its content, including
our uses of pair programming, personal projects, and a growth model
that brings students from block-based programming to professional
Jupyter data notebooks. We consider the effects the camps have on
students' self-efficacy and perceptions of computer science. We
conclude with recommendations and guidelines for those intending
to offer similar camps.
