We are grateful to the Grinnell Innovation Fund and the Grinnell
Student-Faculty Research Fund for providing the resources to offer
this camp at low or no cost to our campers.  The Roy J. Carver
Charitable Trust supported a broader Data Science initiative at
Grinnell which influenced our work on this project.  Our IRB provided
useful feedback on the instrument and the project.  Our fellow
students graciously spoke with the campers about their research
projects.  Professor Ursula Wolz provided us with advice about ways
to approach teaching this age group and Professor Shonda Kuiper in
statistics provided feedback on our approach to data science.  Dr.
Narren Brown supported the design of our instrument as part of a
prior project.  Counselors Elise Brod, Gabby Dahlby Albrith, David
Kreis, Hans Larsson, and Jonathan B. Rebelsky provided necessary
support for this project; we know it's hard to support someone
else's curriculum, and they did a great job.  Finally, we appreciate
the enthusiastic participation of our campers!
