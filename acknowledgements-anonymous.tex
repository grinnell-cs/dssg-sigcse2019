We are grateful to the Anonymous Fund for providing the resources
to offer this camp at low or no cost to our campers.  Our IRB provided
useful feedback on the instrument and the project.  Our fellow
students in the department graciously spoke with the campers about
their research projects.  Visiting Professor Anonymous provided us
with advice about ways to approach teaching this age group and
Professor Anonymous in statistics provided feedback on our approach
to data science.  Colleage X supported the design of our instrument
as part of a prior project.  Counselors One, Two, and Three provided
necessary support for this project; we know it's hard to support
someone else's curriculum, and they did a great job.  Finally, we
appreciate the enthusiastic participation of our campers!
